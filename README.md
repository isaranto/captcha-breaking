# Leveraging machine learning for breaking captcha challenges

Check the ipython notebook and the presentation(the pdf file).
The notebook includes the random generation of some "easy" captchas and the pipeline of a ML procedure (using SVM) to learn and predict captchas of this type. 
A simple web form is included in order to get the image and then test it.
